# Climbing-Fall-Device-IoT
Devices used for climbing/hiking that can detect emergency falls in areas with no internet access.

Collaborators: Endric Daues, Jens Daci, Daniel Klass

- A remote device for climbing/hiking that can detect emergency falls in areas with no internet access.
- Obtained raw data from the accelerometer, performed a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and extracted necessary features to help in detecting human actions such as resting, walking, and climbing.
- A base station that communicates with the remote device using LoRa Radio Transceiver and signals emergency contacts through Email, Text Message, and Twitter.
- The Amazon AWS Cloud database was used to store the emergency contacts and new ML models.

The following project video shows all of the features:
